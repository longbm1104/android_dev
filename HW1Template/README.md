# To-Do List App
## Functionality
This is a mobile app that allow users to add different tasks and specify each task's description. The users can add multiple tasks, and view them
in a list form. When the user click on the task that they have created, they can edit the task name and/or description. In addition, the user can 
pick a due time for each of their tasks. When the user is done with a task, they can check it off from the list. If the user add a task by mistake or want to remove 
a task from their list, they can click the trash icon to delete that task. 

## Challenging Part
The most challenging part of this assignment was using the TaskModelView and RecylerView component, which required a lot of research. To help me understand
those components I used https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/recyclerview and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzjCMa4GBD4&ab_channel=CodeWithCal.

## Hours Took to Complete
